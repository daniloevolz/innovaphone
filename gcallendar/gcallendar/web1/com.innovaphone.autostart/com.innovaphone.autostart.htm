    <h1>com.innovaphone.autostart</h1>

    <p>
        If the com.innovaphone.autostart API is declared by a hidden app, the myApps client auto-starts that app.
        This mechanism is intended for background services that should always run.
    </p>

    <h3>Remarks</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>The autostart mechanism only applies for apps with the hidden flag.</li>
            <li>Autostart apps are never closed. They should be able to handle and recover from errors without a restart. I.e. they should not call start.Close().</li>
            <li>Before using com.innovaphone.autostart, consider if your hidden app really needs to run unconditionally. In most use cases hidden apps can be started by API messages from another app.</li>
            <li>
                Autostart apps should be designed to be very careful with resources. Keep in mind that the app will be always running on all clients on all platforms. Hints:
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep your app small, so it can be loaded quickly. Don't include files in your HTML that are not needed in a hidden app (like CSS and UI libraries).</li>
                    <li>Only have network connections open when you need them.</li>
                    <li>Avoid CPU intensive operations.</li>
                    <li>Use exponential back-offs for retries. Avoid retries if they won't succeed in the specific environment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
